# loginhelp_googleappengine
when you create a new app with google app engine, it will make a folder where 'app.yaml' , 'main.py', 'index.yaml' and 'favicon.ico' will be present.
You should copy the contents of the 'main.py' file here to the 'main.py' in the folder and make sure that the app.yaml file has same contents.
Run the google app engine and check its functions.
Then you can modify the codes for your requirements.
Best Wishes.
